# Data Science Learning Journey 

This repository documents my end-to-end journey in learning data science:
from Python and SQL fundamentals to machine learning and real-world projects.

## Goals
- Build strong foundations in data analysis & machine learning
- Create reproducible, well-documented projects
- Develop a portfolio suitable for data analyst / junior data scientist roles

## Structure
Each folder corresponds to a learning phase:
- Python, SQL, Statistics
- EDA & Visualization
- Machine Learning
- Projects (mid-level and capstone)

## Projects
- Mid-level projects focus on analysis & modeling
- Capstone projects are end-to-end and production-oriented

## Tools
Python, Pandas, NumPy, SQL, Scikit-learn, Git, Jupyter, Tableau/Power BI

## Progress
- [ ] Python basics
- [ ] SQL fundamentals
- [ ] Statistics
- [ ] EDA projects
- [ ] Machine Learning
- [ ] Capstone project
